# CuriosityBOT

One of my first tries on making a stable, simple and easy to use bot for Discord. Might aswell add more functionality later, but this basic version can handle everything a normal discord server might need.

Suggestions/bug reports are always appreciated, contact me on Discord for reporting any bugs that you find in this version.

My Discord tag: **DiaBlo#6239**

Thank you for reading this useless README.MD, you're epic. <3
